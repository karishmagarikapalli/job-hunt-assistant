The server salesforce data model was built using several standard and custom Salesforce objects. Implemented several RESTful connectors with various AWS services to fetch and synchronize the metadata required for calculating and updating pricing, promotions, and discounts.\n\u25cf Conceptualized and executed the design of HTTP APIs, thereby facilitating a seamless integration framework connecting web applications and backend systems. Pioneered the development of a microservice designed to manage, execute, and perpetuate a schedule of promotion disbursements. This feat was achieved through a skillful orchestration of EventBridge, Statemachines, Step functions, DynamoDB, and SQS queues. A concurrent microservice was engineered to apprise end customers of schedule progress using SES notifications.\n\u25cf Optimized database queries and improved system efficiency through performance tuning and code refactoring.\n\u25cf Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather and analyze user requirements, ensuring alignment with business objectives.\n\u25cf Actively participated in Agile methodologies, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.\n\u25cf Led a team of developers in designing and building a scalable and secure feature using AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and Amazon Lambda",
